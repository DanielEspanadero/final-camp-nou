## Goals

_Create a program that avoids speculation in soccer players_

## Innovation

_The innovative part of our project is that we have based ourselves on the common denominator of different economic schools and we can offer precise data on the real price of the players and different characteristics._

## Coordination
_To coordinate the team, we have decided that each one focuses on a different task in which we set ourselves different common and specific objectives. We chose to work with javaScript, node.js, express, mongo since they were languages that all the members of the team mastered._

## Ambition and growth
_Our goal is to improve our program every season, the next step for the MVP is to create some design patterns that help improve the scalability of the project, such as dependency injection._
